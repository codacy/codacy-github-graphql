# codacy-github-graphql

Library with Apollo compiled queries and models for GitHub API V4

## Build

```sh
./gradlew build
```

## FAQ

1. How to add a new query?
    * Create file in `src/main/graphql/com/github/api/v4` with the query
    * Check if any new scalar is needed.
    Look in `com.github.api.v4.type.CustomType` if all the types there already have CustomTypeAdapter
    that is linked in `com.codacy.graphql.apollo.client.ApolloClient` (look for a `addCustomTypeAdapter`)

2. How to add a CustomTypeAdapter?
    * Check what is the original type of the scalar in the `src/main/graphql/com/github/api/v4/schema.graphql` (e.g.: Date in a string format, long, ...)
    * Check package `com.codacy.graphql.adapter` for examples and possible implementations for existing API types
    * Add invocation of `addCustomTypeAdapter` when creating the `com.codacy.graphql.apollo.client.ApolloClient`

3. How to handle `Inline Fragments`?
    * The visitor provided by the generator should help but for some reason it is not being generated. 
    For now, since they can be of multiple types you need to check the instance type and to cast :(
